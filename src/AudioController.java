 * The Audio Controller is used for managing audio in the game and relies on the LWJGL and Slick-Util packages.
 *
 * It can be used by having individual objects each have their own soundcontroller or by creating a public soundcontroller in whichever class has main.
 * The former use is recommended for sound effects as it allows similar object to have sound effects that are different but have the same names.
 * The latter use is recommended for music as it allows global access.
